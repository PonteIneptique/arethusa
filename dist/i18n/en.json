Extensibility is a guiding design goal - Arethusa includes tools for automatic generation of new plugin skeletons (<a href=\"https://github.com/latin-language-toolkit/arethusa-cli\">Arethusa::CLI</a>) and detailed <a href=\"http://github.com/latin-language-toolkit/arethusa/blob/docs/docs/content/plugin_guide.md\">development guides</a> are currently in progress, with the hopes that others will be able to reuse and build upon the platform to add support for other annotation types, languages and back-end repositories and workflow engines.",
